# Tailwind-css-projects
Hi there,
1. Today i created a small project using tailwind css . Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework.
2. Tailwind  offers several advantages over traditional CSS. Its utility-first approach and pre-defined classes make styling HTML components faster, more efficient, and more consistent.
3. The best way to learn tailwind css is to make projects using the official docs of tailwind css .

I made a simple card using it .
